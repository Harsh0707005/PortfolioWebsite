      <span>I started my programming journey around 3 years back with Python with the motive to develop 2D games using Pygame, soon this hobby turned into a passion, pursuing which gave me this incredible sense of fulfilment and satisfaction. Following which, I continued to explore about App and Web development and learnt languages like Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS and backend Databases like MongoDB.</span>

      <span>As a first-year data science student at IIT Madras, I'm thrilled to explore my passions and expand my skills in the tech industry. With a strong focus on programming and a keen interest in cybersecurity, I'm constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my knowledge.</span>

      <span>As a self-taught programmer, I've honed my coding skills through various projects and challenges. My curiosity about cyber security has led me to explore various concepts and techniques due to which even small vulnerabilities can lead to exploitation of application. This helps me to develop secure applications to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.</span>

      <span>I also have a passion for writing about Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking. I have written numerous articles on these topics. As a result, I was accepted as a Technical Content Writer at GeeksforGeeks, and my work has been featured in Infosec Write-ups, one of Medium's largest publications on cyber security. I'm always eager to share my knowledge and learn from others in the industry.</span>
